<h2>Discover the Dark</h2>
<ul>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Explore through the dark using your lantern and find the exit door.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
Uneasiness and caution from not knowing what is around.
</li>

<li><strong>Genre:</strong>
A 2D platformer.
</li>

<li><strong>Game play:</strong>
Use the arrow keys to move left and right and the spacebar to jump. Navigate your way through the level to find the exit door. Future versions will have enemies, remembering where you have been, and more.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype goal:</strong>
vision reduction
</li>

<li><strong>Features:</strong>
Severe lack of information on surrounings.
</li>

<li><strong>Setting/Premise:</strong>
The world is set in modern day. It takes place underground in a cave in North America. The main character is a spelunker who dropped all of their gear except for their lantern when exploring and he needs it in order to get out so he has to go in deeper in an attempt to find his gear.
</li>

<li><strong>Story:</strong>
As the spelunker starts on his search for his gear he finds strange creatures he has never seen nor heard about before. The absolute darkness combined with the strange fog that appears to be everywhere down there combines to the effect that he can't see more than a few feet away with his lantern. Most of the creatures see him as their next meal. Luckily and strangely though, he finds what appears to be a indredibly old and crude spear. Can he survive the creatures hiding in the darkness long enough to find his gear and escape?
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
People who like platformers and/or exploring.
</li>

<li><strong>Play time:</strong>
Currently it takes around a minute or less.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
Exploring the entirety of levels in order to not miss anything and being cautious.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
I used assets found on the internet.
